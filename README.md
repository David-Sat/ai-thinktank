# AI ThinkTank
AI ThinkTank can be accessedÂ [here](https://thinktank.streamlit.app/).

AI ThinkTank leverages the power of Large Language Models to simulate expert debates on any topic. Users can insert an image URL and the system automatically generates a topic of debate based on the image, using Gemini Pro Vision. Thereafter the system dynamically generates relevant experts who autonomously engage in a debate. Additionally, users have the option to join the discussion, adding an interactive element to the experience.
